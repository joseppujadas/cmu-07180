Map representation for search and rescue domain
A map is composed of cells, which can be either 'Free', 'Wall' or 'Entry'.
Free cells can have an obstruction cost (integer 1-9) and whether
 a victim is in that cell
Exactly one cell in a map is the Entry point to the building,
 and it needs to be adjacent to the outer boundary of the map
Locn is the (row, col) location of a cell
